# Tasty

A catalogue of recipes - A Single Page Application which fetches data from [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api) and stores it in the Redux store, then displays it on the website. The website has two pages using a unique route. The first page shows a list on Recipes and the second page shows information about a specific recipe.
